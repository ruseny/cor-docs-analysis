# Analysis of Committee of the Regions Documents

This is an unfinished project to extract data from Committee of the Regions douments, and conduct analyses on that dataset.

The main notebook, written in R and formatted as R markdown, documents several procedures of text processing and analysis:
- Use of html source files of the online document search portal to automate file download (API not available)
- Use of stringr package from tidyverse and regular expressions to generate datasets from the set of documents
- Preliminary regression models to explore existing patterns

The code base was created in collaboration with [David Steinecke](https://www.polver.uni-konstanz.de/en/leuffen/team/team-prof-dirk-leuffen/david-steinecke/)

Note that the notebook is not fully functional without some additional documents, which are omitted due to storage limitations.
